So Ricky has finished sorting the community task list for me and I've saved it as a csv.

(MVP) What I'd like to be able to do is:
- Select one/multiple times from a checkbox menu.
- Select which equipment I have from a checkbox menu.
- Click "Give me a task".
- The program outputs all of the tasks that fits those requirements in a list, shuffled. (If the task doesn't require equipment, it shows - equipment selection just eliminates unchecked boxes)
- Be able to update the database by feeding it a new csv file.

(No idea how feasible these are) Extra things:
- Add a "limits" column to the database that will further filter out tasks based on limits.
- Set up "profiles" of subs where I can save pre-set inputs for equipment and limits, so all I have to do is select e.g. "a half hour task for Nici" and it'll correctly filter out tasks where Nici doesn't have that equipment or has the task as a limit.
- Being able to output 3 tasks instead of all of them. (Or select a number.)
- Being able to remove an entry from the database from within the program (e.g. by clicking "Don't show me this task again")
